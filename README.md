## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Sass
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I'm not convinced that the 13px font size specified in the style guide is correct. I settled on 13.25px in the end.

I used a lot of hardcoded measurements for widths, which I'm not proud of.

Animating the state change in the footer was the biggest challenge. The Javascript was pretty straightforward:

```js
function onClick() {
  var thisItem = document.getElementById('footer');
  thisItem.classList.toggle("active");
};
```

Positioning the hovering share section on desktop was tricky. Again, I had to hardcode a px measurement, which makes me feel all kinds of icky.

### Continued development

It's not fully responsive; I hardcoded two widths for the card. Animating the share section into view would be nice.

### Useful resources

- [Bubbler â€“ CSS Speech Bubble Generator](https://www.ilikepixels.co.uk/bubbler/) - This helped me get the ::after element on the hovering share section correct.
